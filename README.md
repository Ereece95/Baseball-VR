  Introduction
  ------------
	This project is creating a simulated baseball game where there are no actual game elements it is just to practice your swing. The ball is thrown based on stats froman actual pitcher and with a controller you will swing and hit or miss the ball based on where you swing. You will be recorded and compared to an actual batter. It is less of playing baseball game and more of a training your swing and recognizing pitches game to improve your skill in real life.

  Introduction
  ------------
	This project is creating a simulated baseball game where there are no actual game elements it is just to practice your swing. The ball is thrown based on stats froman actual pitcher and with a controller you will swing and hit or miss the ball based on where you swing. You will be recorded and compared to an actual batter. It is less of playing baseball game and more of a training your swing and recognizing pitches game to improve your skill in real life.

### Items Implemented: 

- More pitch types: {Slider and Sinker}
- Use the stats from MLB website to throw pitches and where to go in the strike zone
- Have flags appear when hit the ground
- Have the ball randomly apply force in a random direction (For now)
-Have ball collide with a bat rather than a spacebar press
- Upgrade the GUI and add to it
- Display the players stats upon leaving the game
- Have a video comparison for good ways to swing a bat
- Add Audio and more Art
- Add different levels of difficulty
